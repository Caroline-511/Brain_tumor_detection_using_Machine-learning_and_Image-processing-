# Brain_tumor_detection_using_Machine-learning_and_Image-processing-

In this project, we aim to build a CNN architecture which gives higher accuracy compared to the existing and standard models. <br/><br/>

<b>The main objectives of this project are </b><br/>
•	Build a model which gives higher accuracy than the standard models <br/>
•	Compare the accuracies with the standard models<br/>
•	Use the various CNN layers and experiment with it in order to increase the accuracy<br/>
•	Build a model which is different from the standard model<br/>
•	Use two different datasets, having different number of images in order to compare which dataset gives higher accuracy<br/>
•	For the given image, predict the class<br/>
